This repo is comprised of utilities that I use across various go projects.

## Development Environment Setup
The following steps can be followed to prepare your environment to hack on `goutils`:

1. (Fork this project](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)
2. Install Dependencies:
   * [Golang](https://go.dev/doc/install)
   * [Pre-Commit](https://pre-commit.com/#install)
   * [Mage](https://magefile.org/):
      ```
      go install github.com/magefile/mage@latest
      ```
3. Run the following command to set up `go.mod` for development with your fork:
```
REPO=github.com/l50/goutils
FORK="${PWD}"

echo -e "\nreplace ${REPO} => ${FORK}" >> go.mod
```
4. Set up Pre-Commit hooks locally:
```
mage precommit
```
