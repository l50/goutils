This repo is comprised of utilities that I use across various go projects.

## Development
The following steps can be followed to prepare your environment to hack on `goutils`:

1. Install Mage:
```
go install github.com/magefile/mage@latest
```

2. Run the following command to set up `go.mod` for development with your fork:
```
REPO=github.com/l50/goutils
FORK="${PWD}"

echo -e "\nreplace ${REPO} => ${FORK}" >> go.mod
```

3. Install Pre-Commit by following these instructions: https://pre-commit.com/#install

4. Set up Pre-Commit hooks locally:
```
mage precommit
```
